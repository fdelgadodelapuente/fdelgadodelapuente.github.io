# **Anthropogenic Deformation**

Human activity can induce deformation in the crust triggered by fluid extraction among other factors. These deformation signals can be measured from the space with InSAR and its impact over groundwater resources and infrastructure monitored.

ALOS-2 SM3 interferogram that shows 2.5 cm of line-of-sight (LOS) subsidence in the Salar de Atacama basin. The subsidence results from a drop of ~10 m in the phreatic level in several wells due to brine extraction (blue circles). The LOS uplift in the SE and E part of the salar likely results from a combination of either salt growth and/or soil moisture changes in response to episodic rains triggered by the Andean monsoon.

### **Relevant publications**

None yet, but there will be one that will be part of Joaquin Castillo's MSc thesis.
