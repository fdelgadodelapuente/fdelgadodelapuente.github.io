# **Anthropogenic Deformation**

InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) has revolutionized volcanology providing dense geodetic observations (up to ~0.5 m/pixel, most likely 10-30 m/pixel), albeit with a poor temporal sampling (1-42 days depending on the SAR platform). One of the major limitations of the method is the presence of atmospheric signals produced by water vapor and pressure changes that are correlated with the topography. In the case of stratovolcanoes, these signals mimic ground deformation produced by magma reservoir pressurization, and can be very challenging to mitigate for the time scales of volcanic eruptions (0.01 - 10 days). I'm interested in developing and comparing approaches that can reduce the effect of these artifacts.

On the other hand, volcano deformation is recorded over spatial scales that vary between a few tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers, produced by conduit pressurisation or very shallow sources to lower crustal intrusions. Ice covered volcanoes such as those in the Southern Andes are likely to pressurise only near the volcano summit, in areas where instrument deployments are very difficult due to harsh environmental conditions. These signals require specific acquisition plans to be potentially detectable by InSAR, hence I am also interested on using the complete civilian SAR constellation (TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, COSMO-SkyMED, RADARSAT-2, Sentinel-1A/B and ALOS-2) and the unique characteristics of each satellite to better understand volcanic processes over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales.
