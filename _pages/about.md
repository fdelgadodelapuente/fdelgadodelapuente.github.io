Welcome to the Crustal Deformation and InSAR Geodesy lab at Universidad de Chile!

I am an InSAR geodesist and volcanologist with strong deviations to active tectonics from Chile. I am assistant professor at the Department of Geology of Universidad de Chile. 

My research focuses on the use of space geodetic data to understand physical processes in volcanic systems. Specifically I use InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) to study magma storage and transport in the shallow crust, and eruption dynamics. Most of my work has focused in the restless volcanoes of the Southern Andes in Chile, one of the most active volcanic provinces in the world in the past 40 years. In the Southern Andes I have worked at Villarrica, Calbuco, Cordon Caulle, Chaiten and Hudson volcanoes among others, plus volcanic systems elsewhere like Sabancaya (Peru), Ambrym, Yellowstone, and Sierra Negra. I am also interested in active tectonics, glaciology and crustal deformation.
