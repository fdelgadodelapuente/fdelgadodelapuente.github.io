Welcome to the Crustal Deformation and InSAR Geodesy lab at Universidad de Chile!

I am a volcanologist from Chile, fascinated by volcanoes, lava flows, eruptive columns and all the cool things that volcanoes erupt and do! I am assistant professor at the Department of Geology of Universidad de Chile. Before this position I obtained my PhD in Geological Sciences at Cornell University in 2018. I was then a CNES (Centre Nationale d'Etudes Spatiales, French Space Agency) postdoctoral researcher at the équipe de Tectonique et Mécanique de la Lithosphère at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris. 

My research focuses on the use of space geodetic data to understand physical processes in volcanic systems. Specifically I use InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) to study magma storage and transport in the shallow crust, and eruption dynamics. Most of my work has focused in the restless volcanoes of the Southern Andes in Chile, one of the most active volcanic provinces in the world in the past 40 years. In the Southern Andes I have worked at Villarrica, Calbuco, Cordon Caulle, Chaiten and Hudson volcanoes among others, plus volcanic systems elsewhere like Sabancaya (Peru), Ambrym, Yellowstone, and Sierra Negra. I am also interested in active tectonics, glaciology and crustal deformation. In my pre scientific life I worked as a junior geophysicist in exploration and marine geophysics.
