I am a volcanologist from Chile, fascinated by volcanoes, lava flows, eruptive columns and all the cool things that volcanoes erupt and do! I am assistant professor at the Department of Geology of Universidad de Chile. Before this position I obtained my PhD in Geological Sciences at Cornell University in July 2018 with a thesis on magma storage, transport and eruptive dynamics constrained with InSAR. I was then a CNES (Centre Nationale d'Etudes Spatiales, French Space Agency) postdoctoral researcher at the Equipe de Tectonique et Mecanique de la Litosphere at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris. 

My research focuses on the use of space geodetic data to understand physical processes in volcanic systems. Specifically I use InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) to study magma storage and transport in the shallow crust, and eruption mechanisms. I also develop physics-based eruptive models of effusive eruptions. Most of my work has focused in the restless volcanoes of the Southern Andes in Chile, one of the most active volcanic provinces in Latin America, including Villarrica, Llaima, Calbuco, Cordon Caulle, Chaiten and Hudson volcanoes. I have also worked in other volcanic systems including Sabancaya, Ubinas (both in Peru), Ambrym in Vanuatu and Yellowstone in the US. I am also interested in active tectonics and crustal deformation. In my pre scientific life I worked as a junior geophysicist in exploration and marine geophysics.
